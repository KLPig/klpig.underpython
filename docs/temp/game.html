        <pre><code lang="python">consturctor(player, monsters, wave_types, resource_path)</code></pre>
        <p>Arguments:</p>
        <li>player: the player, to be mentioned later</li>
        <li>monsters: the list of the monsters since there could be several of them, 
            to be mentioned later</li>
        <li>wave_types: list of the type of the inherited classes of wave, which means <i>list[type[wave]]</i>, 
            for wave, to be mentioned later</li>
        <li>resource_path: path of resources, it should cotain folders like images and sounds, 
            where only files(image and sounds) but not directory(further more folders) inside.
        </li>
        <pre><code>build()</code></pre>

        <pre><code>set_state(state)</code></pre>
        <p>Set the current state to 'state'.</p>
        <h2>Special</h2>
        <p>Something called GAME was a object with type underpython.Game, when you defined a Game, use write_game to pass it to the system, e.g:</p>
        <pre><code lang="python"><br>
from underpython import *<br>

GAME = Game(...args...) # define the GAME object
write_game(GAME) # write it to GAME in system
        </code></pre>
